                <h2> Description </h2> 
                    <p><em> braised lamb shanks </em> 
                    in a delicious, 
                    rich red wine sauce is the kind of showstopping comfort food cravings are made of.</p> 
                    <p> Perfect for a cozy dinner in and a great alternative for roast lamb at Easter.</p>
                
                    <h3> Ingredients </h3>
                        <p> The star of this dish is of course the lamb shanks but without all the aromatics and that delicious sauce, 
                            they would be quite boring. To build a rich sauce, 
                            I start by saut√©ing a mirepoix of onion, carrots and celery. Garlic, rosemary and bay leaf add fragrance and aroma. 
                            Other herbs like fresh thyme or oregano would work well with the lamb too. 
                            The sauce consists of tomato paste, red wine and stock or broth. </p>
